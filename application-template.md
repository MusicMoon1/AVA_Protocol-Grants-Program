## Project Overview

If this application is in response to an Proposal, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful OAK grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

* If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary):
MusicMoon Empowering Artists:
“An AI-powered music creation & Web3 platform that integrates music and instrument NFTs with a DAO to create a supportive ecosystem where artists can create, retain rights, earn royalties, and connect with fans.”


* A brief description of your project.

“Create, Earn your Royalties & Build your Community”
MusicMoon is an “AI-powered music creation & Web3 platform that integrates music and instrument NFTs with a DAO to create a supportive ecosystem where artists can create, retain rights, earn royalties, and connect with fans.” The platform integrates LiveLoop "The Looping Software for Live Music Performance", and it's new AI feature which enhances live performances with real-time AI variations. MusicMoon features a Community Engagement DAO for artist-audience interaction, a Platform Governance DAO for stakeholder decision-making, and an NFT marketplace for minting and trading music NFTs. The MusicMoon ICO establishes the platform's economy, supporting transactions and community governance. MusicMoon is also being developed on multiple other blockchains, and the token will interconnect all MusicMoon platforms across different blockchains, ensuring seamless integration and functionality throughout the entire ecosystem. 

* An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into OAK Network or Turing Network.

By integrating with OAK Network and Turing Network, MusicMoon can enhance its platform’s efficiency, security, and scalability, offering artists and users a more sophisticated and automated experience. This partnership would also align MusicMoon with the broader Polkadot ecosystem, opening up further opportunities for cross-chain interactions and growth. MusicMoon, as a platform that integrates AI and blockchain technology for the creation, distribution, and monetization of music, can leverage both OAK Network and Turing Network in several ways:

	1.	Automated Royalties Distribution: By integrating with OAK Network, MusicMoon can automate the distribution of royalties to artists and contributors in a trustless, transparent manner. Smart contracts on Turing Network could be used to automatically trigger payments based on predefined conditions (e.g., a certain number of streams or sales).
	2.	Scheduled NFT Drops: OAK Network’s automation capabilities can be utilized to schedule and automate NFT releases or drops. Artists on MusicMoon could set up their NFT sales or auctions to occur at specific times or under certain conditions, ensuring they reach their audience at the optimal moment.
	3.	Cross-Chain Asset Management: Given that OAK Network operates within the Polkadot ecosystem, MusicMoon can enable cross-chain interactions, allowing users to manage their NFTs and other digital assets across different blockchains seamlessly. This would enhance the platform’s interoperability and user reach.
	4.	Complex Workflows for Music Rights Management: Turing Network’s programmable automation could be employed to manage complex workflows related to music rights, licensing, and distribution. For example, automated processes could be set up to handle disputes, issue licenses, or transfer ownership of music rights, all governed by smart contracts.

* An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

The MusicMoon team is driven by a shared passion for transforming the music industry through the innovative use of AI and blockchain technology. Each member brings a unique blend of expertise that fuels our collective vision to empower artists, giving them control over their creations, rights, and revenues in ways that have never been possible before.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
We are pleased to inform you that MusicMoon is already live, and we have fully figured out all aspects of the platform, including the UI/UX design. Our team has meticulously crafted and tested the user interface to ensure a seamless experience for our users. Given that we are in the live stage, all UI components are not just mockups or designs but are functional and operational within the platform.

This allows us to move forward with confidence in the final state of our project, as our platform is actively being used and continuously improved based on real user feedback.


* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

We are pleased to share that MusicMoon is already live, and our data models and API specifications for core functionality have been fully developed and implemented. These models and APIs are designed to support the seamless operation of our platform, including NFT creation, royalty distribution, and DAO management.

Since our platform is in the live stage, these components are not just theoretical but are actively being used in production. This ensures that our system is robust, scalable, and ready to handle real-world demands as we continue to grow and enhance the platform.

* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
* What your project is __not__ or will __not__ provide or implement
  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe __the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible__, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to OAK Network or Turing Network. We **recommend** that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. __Treat it as a contract__; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested __per milestone__.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish __under the terms of the license__ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
